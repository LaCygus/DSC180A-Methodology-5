## Robust and Interpretable Neural Network Models for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
### Lily Weng, Section B01

## Most Interesting Topic Covered in My Domain This Quarter:
Our work this quarter on **Robust and Interpretable Neural Network Models for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing** has been particularly interesting because of the in-depth examination of various neural network models. In particular, examining how well CLIP-Dissect, Net Dissect, and MILAN labels perform at different layers and on a structured 1–5 scale has been really interesting. Gaining knowledge about how these models perceive and classify images can help us understand how they behave.

## Potential Investigation for My Quarter 2 Project:
I am eager to conduct a deeper analysis of the variables affecting the accuracy variations seen across layers and labels as I anticipate Quarter 2. A primary goal will be to investigate methods for improving the models' interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, examining the effects of various training approaches and experimenting with adversarial examples may provide insightful viewpoints for enhancing overall model performance.

## Potential Change to My Quarter 1 Project Approach:
After giving the Quarter 1 Project some thought, I might modify my strategy to include improving the scoring standards for the 0–5 scale that was used to assess the models. Priority will be given to adjusting the scoring criteria for each score and making sure that the process is more impartial and standardized. This modification attempts to rectify the issues that arose from the first inquiry and improve the precision of our assessments.

## Other Techniques of Interest in My Project:
I'm especially interested in investigating other methods for my project, like data augmentation, attention mechanisms, and transfer learning. These strategies have the potential to greatly enhance our neural network models' resilience and interpretability. My continued research will also need to take into account utilizing explainability tools and cutting-edge architectures to gain a deeper understanding of model decisions.
